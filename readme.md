##### IMPORTANT: This is the new repository for our project. We switched to the Laravel Framework since with the NodeJS framework we had to do a lot of nested callbacks (see http://callbackhell.com/).

## How to setup the database connection to run the website
1) Create a new connection if you don't have an existing one
  Go to the home page (click on the home icon on top LHS of page). You should see in the middle of the page 'MySQL Connections'
  Click on the '+' next to MYSQL Connections
2) Setup your connection with mySQL 
  Connection Method: Standard (TCP/IP)
  Hostname: localhost Port:3306
  Username: root
3) Click Test connecton. A message should appear: " A successful mySQL connection was made with the parameters defined for this connection" 
4) On the homepage, click on the new connection, enter the password (the one we always use)
5) File > Run Script > Select the init.sql in app/docker/mariadb (in your laravel project directory)
6) It should be successful including for : GRANT ALL ON conushop.* TO conushop@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'isY2metT';
7) Also, if you click on the LHS panel Server Status , you should see on the RHS a button saying Server  Status Running
8) To test the connection to mariaddb in cmd run : 
  ping mariadb. 
9) If it says Ping request could not find mariadb, this means you have not set mariadb  as host
10) Use Notepad and right-click , run as Administrator and find file C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\host
11) Edit by adding a new host:
  127.0.0.1    mariadb
12) Then rerun: ping mariadb
13) You should receive a message containing Reply from 127.0.0.1 (meaning the connection works)
14) Re rerun the SQL script in case. Click on File > Run Script > Select the init.sql in app/docker/mariadb (in your laravel project directory)
14) Run laravel.dev

7) **DO NOT CHECK THE BOX** next to Use path mapping, since you are only using a localhost as server

10) Click Apply
11) Click OK

## How to run the debugger
1) Set a breakpoint/+ where you would like to debug (click on the right of the row number, and a red circle should appear). Or you can do Run > Toggle line Breakpoint
